Ever been in the zone, deeply focused on your work or studies, only to be constantly interrupted by a flood of messages? It's frustrating, right? That's why I created WifeAlert, an app that solves this problem. With WifeAlert, my fianc√©e can easily grab my attention when it's truly important, like when she needs my help or has something urgent to discuss.

WifeAlert lets her control the smart lights near my desk. With a single press of a button, she can invoke a simple toggle or strobe pattern on the lights, notifying me without disrupting my flow. It's the perfect balance between staying focused and being available when needed. Now, I no longer need to feel bad about ignoring my phone knowing she can get my attention.
